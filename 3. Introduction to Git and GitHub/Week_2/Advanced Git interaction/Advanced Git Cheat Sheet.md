.gitignore files
.gitignore files are used to tell the git tool to intentionally ignore some files in a given Git repository. For example, this can be useful for configuration files or metadata files that a user may not want to check into the master branch. Check out more at: 
https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore
.

A few common examples of file patterns to exclude can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/octocat/9257657)https://gist.github.com/octocat/9257657
