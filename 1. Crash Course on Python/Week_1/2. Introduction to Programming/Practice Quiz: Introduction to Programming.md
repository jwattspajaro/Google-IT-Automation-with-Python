## Practice Quiz: Introduction to Programming


<br>

### Question 1

What’s a computer program?
⚪ A set of languages available in the computer

⚪ A process for getting duplicate values removed from a list

⚫ **A list of instructions that the computer has to follow to reach a goal**

⚪ A file that gets copied to all machines in the network

>  At a basic level, a computer program is a recipe of instructions that tells your computer what to do.

## Question 2

What’s the syntax of a language?

⚫ **The rules of how to express things in that language**

⚪ The subject of a sentence

⚪ The difference between one language and another

⚪ The meaning of the words

> In a human language, syntax is the rules for how a sentence is constructed, and in a programming language, syntax is the rules for how each instruction is written.

## Question 3

What’s the difference between a program and a script?

⚫ **There’s not much difference, but scripts are usually simpler and shorter.**

⚪ Scripts are only written in Python.

⚪ Scripts can only be used for simple tasks.

⚪ Programs are written by software engineers; scripts are written by system administrators.

> The line between a program and a script is blurry; scripts usually have a shorter development cycle. This means that scripts are shorter, simpler, and can be written very quickly.

## Question 5

What are semantics when applied to programming code and pseudocode?

⚪ The rules for how a programming instruction is written

⚪ The difference in number values in one instance of a script compared to another

⚫ **The effect the programming instructions have**

⚪ The end result of a programming instruction
